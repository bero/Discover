Discover has been available since 1998. It first supported D2 and then from D3 to D2007. 

Discover doesn't support the last D2009 and D2010 versions. What is missing is the handling of the new ''dproj'' files, and the handling of the generics and the anonymous methods. Maybe that these features are ''almost'' supported, it is just a matter of reverse engineering the format of the Map file. Probably, also, the code parser has to be updated.

Discover has been compiled using D2010, I guess it could be recompiled without changes using D5 to D2007.
