WHAT IS DISCOVER
================
Discover is an analysis tool that allows Delphi developers 
to measure how thoroughly their programs have been tested.
Discover shows interactively and directly in the source code
which basic-blocks (code sequences that always execute sequentially)
have been executed at least once and which have never been executed.
Using this information, the testers or the developers can perform
actions or run specific tests to eliminate these uncovered areas.


INSTALLATION
============
To install Discover, just copy (or extract) the 
files (exe and rtf) to a directory of your choice.
Discover does not use the registry.


UNINSTALLATION
==============
To remove Discover, just delete its files...
