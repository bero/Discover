# Discover
Code coverage for Delphi

Discover is an analysis tool that allows to measure how thoroughly Delphi programs have been tested. It shows interactively and directly in the source code which code sequences have been executed at least once and which have never been executed.

Forked from http://sourceforge.net/projects/discoverd
